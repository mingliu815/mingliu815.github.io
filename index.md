## Hello, a little bit about me

I am a second-year PhD student at Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program in Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA. My research interest lies in applying the power of statistics theory and computer science to explore new genetic factors of complex human diseases. Beyond research, I enjoy singing, baking, swimming, tennis, golf, and hang out with my friends and family.
